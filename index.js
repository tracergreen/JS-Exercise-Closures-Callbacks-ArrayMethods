 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 * 
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 * 
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/* Task 1: `counterMaker`
 * Study the code for counter1 and counter2. Answer the questions below.
 * 
 * 1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2? // counter2 will reset each time the function is called, whereas counter1 will store the memory of the function contained within it due to closure.
 * 
 * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell? // counter1 code has a closure of count++ reaching out to the "let count = 0;", count is accessable from the inside of this closure to the outter function counterMaker.
 * 
 * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better? Since this is a counter, you need memory for your count, so counter1 code seems like a better option. If you were just trying to generate the number 1 over and over, you would want counter2.

/* Task 2: inning() 

Write a function called `inning` that generates a random number of points that a team scored in an inning. This should be a whole number between 0 and 2. */

/* Task 3: finalScore()

Write a higher order function called `finalScore` that accepts the callback function `inning` (from above) and a number of innings and and returns the final score of the game in the form of an object.

For example, 

finalScore(inning, 9) might return:

Create a function called `scoreboard` that accepts the following parameters: 

(1) Callback function `getInningScore`

8th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
9th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
